# MinecraftMaps
 
This is a public repository of some of my Minecraft work done over the years. The vast majority of this public content are multiplayer PvP maps for PGM (PvP Game Manager plugin) severs.

## Gamemodes

5CP (5 Capture Points): Based off of TF2, teams must capture all 5 hills sequentially. Usually these hills are placed in a line and consist of forward spawns once specific hills are capped. 

CTF (Capture the Flag): Teams will have to have to capture the enemy's flag(s) and bring it back to their net on their own side. Some maps consist of multiple flags to allow for player splits and accomodate for more players. Flags drop upon death and stay on the ground to be picked back up for a limited amount of time before despawning and returning to the original post.

CTW (Capture the Wool): Similar to CTF, CTW has teams capture the enemy's wool and place it on their victory monument. Maps consist of wool rooms which are safe regions for you to enter on the enemy side which give special gear to help aid an escape. Once a wool is captured, the objective is complete and doesn't respawn. These maps have block interaction and allow for teams to create defensive walls and pits while bridging across the void gaps to serve as chokepoints for choosing to attack.

DTCM (Destroy the Core/Monument): Teams must destroy an objective on the enemy side with the tools in their kit. Cores have lava inside which needs to leak out and reach a certain y-level to be completed. Monuments consist of a bundle of special blocks that must be 100% destroyed in order to be completed. There is a bunch of block interaction similar to CTW in this gamemode. 

KOTF (King of the Flag): Teams fight over a respawning flag in the center of the map and must hold the flag to gain points. Flag carriers have low health and are easy to pick off. The team carrying the flag cannot respawn until the flag is dropped, allowing the enemy to have an easier way of killing the flag carrier. There are multiple posts in which the flag can respawn and gives enough time for teams to fight over the next flag spawn.

KOTH (King of the Hill): Multiple hills will be placed around the map and will reward points based on who is in control of them. Hills will have a captured state which rewards points and a neutral state which doesn't reward points. Capturing a point that the enemy owns will make it neutral before later capturing it in your favor.

Lobbies: Central hubs for players to log onto before picking a server to play on within the network.

RFW (Race for Wool): Made for the AutoReferee plugin. Teams will have their own respective lanes across a void gap from each other and can never cross or enter the void. They can use bows or TNT cannons to kill the enemy. The goal is to capture all 3 wools within your side which can consist of PvE dungeons and PvP areas where you are exposed to bow fire and risk death. There is a survival element to this gamemode where you must gather resources for better gear and can also eliminate some gear on the enemy side with cannons.

TDM (Team Deathmatch): Teams compete for the most points by being rewarded for killing the enemy. Some maps consist of scoreboxes which reward more points for players who can enter a region on the enemy side as a risk and reward play.
